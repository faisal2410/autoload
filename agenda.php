Title: Building a PHP Project with Composer for Object-Oriented Development

Agenda:

1.Introduction to Composer and Its Benefits
2.Setting Up a New Composer Project
3.Exploring the Composer autoload Feature for OOP




Autoloading allows PHP to load classes automatically without manually including or requiring files. This is essential in OOP, as applications often contain numerous classes spread across different files.

spl_autoload_register() allows us to register custom autoload functions. This function lets us create a loading function that will automatically be called whenever PHP encounters an unknown class.
